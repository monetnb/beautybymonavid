          <h4>Booking Policy:</h4>
          <p>
            You may pay with your preferred form of payment on the day of your
            scheduled appointment. All appointments are booked directly through
            me. To book an appointment you may text me at (949)-423-4646, direct
            message me on instagram, or use the "book now" button on the
            website. No refunds will be granted for any lash services.
          </p>
          <h4>Cancellation/Reschedule Policy:</h4>
          <p>
            A 48 hour notice is required so I can adjust my schedule and
            accommodate other clients. Lashes By Mona reserves the right to
            charge a cancellation fee to the card on file totaling to 50% of the
            scheduled service(s) for appointments that are cancelled or
            rescheduled within 24 hours of your scheduled appointment.
          </p>
          <h4>Appointment Preparation Policy:</h4>
          <p>
            Please thoroughly remove all makeup and skin care products before
            arriving to your lash appointment. Eyes must be clean and oil free
            upon arrival. Please refrain from using eye cream, moisturizer,
            sunscreen, etc. prior to your appointment, as this will result in
            the tape and eye pads not being able to stick or stay in place.
            Please keep in mind, I am unable to properly adhere semi-permanent
            lash extensions on lashes that have make up, residue build up, or
            skin care products near the eye area. I want to ensure maximum
            bonding and retention for your lash extensions so once again, I
            kindly ask that you please arrive with thoroughly clean lashes and
            no make up or skin care products on your face.
          </p>
          <h4>Privacy/Social Media Policy:</h4>

            of its clients and users of this site. Any information Lashes By

          <h4>Late/No Show Policy:</h4>
          <p>
            If you are running late to your appointment, please reach out
            through phone call or text to prevent your appointment from being
            released due to the assumption that you will not show up. Every
            client is given a 15 minute grace period. If you are more than 15
            minutes late. Please keep in mind, my appointments are booked back
            to back. Lashes By Mona reserves the right to charge a no show fee
            totaling up to 100% of the scheduled service for those who do not
            show up to their appointment.

                please keep in mind that everyone has different hair growth
                cycles and no one is the same. Some clients may need fills every
                1-2 weeks, 2-4 weeks, or 4-6 weeks. Retention is different and
                varies from each person. Taking very good care of your lashes
                and keeping them clean is promising for ensuring maximum
                retention.

                You must have 50% of lashes remaining in order to be considered
                a fill. If you are missing 50% or more of your lashes, please
                consult with me prior to your appointment. Lash fills are
                eligible to book one to three weeks after your initial full set
                or last fill. After three weeks, a full set is required. Non

                Redness and irritation are temporary side effects to lash
                extensions. If you have sensitive eyes, you may experience
                redness, irritation, watery eyes, and burning post service.
                These symptoms will subside within 1-3 days and will gradually
                get better over time as your eyes adjust and gets used to the
                adhesive and having lash extensions. If symptoms persist after 3
                days, please consult with me so I can evaluate the situation.

                Please keep in mind during Spring and Fall when the climate
                changes, our lashes shed at a quicker rate and you may
                experience more fall out than normal. Lashes may look thinner
                than normal due to shedding. Also, clients that experience
                seasonal allergies will see quicker fall out at times due to
                inflammation around the eye area. Some clients may have oilier
                skin than others and that's totally normal, as we all have
                different skin types. If you happen to fall under this skin
                type, its highly recommended that you pat your lids dry daily to
                prevent quicker fall out as oil weakens the adhesive bond
                resulting in fall out.
